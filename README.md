**Service Registry**
**Overview**
The Service Registry is a centralized service discovery server built using Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka. It serves as the backbone of microservice communication by allowing services to register themselves and discover other services dynamically. This eliminates the need for hardcoding service locations, enabling flexible and scalable architectures.

**Key Features**
Service Registration: Microservices register themselves with the registry to make their presence known.
Service Discovery: Other microservices can query the registry to discover service instances dynamically.
Load Balancing Support: Works seamlessly with client-side load balancers like Spring Cloud LoadBalancer or Ribbon.
Fault Tolerance: Automatically removes unavailable services from the registry.
Scalability: Supports multiple service instances for better horizontal scalability.

**Technologies Used**
Java 17
Spring Boot
Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka
Maven

**Usage**
Start the Service Registry on the default port 8761.
Configure all microservices to register with the Eureka server by adding the required properties in their configuration files.
Access the Eureka dashboard at http://localhost:8761 to monitor registered services.
Future Use Cases
This repository is designed to be generic and reusable for any microservice-based project. Simply include it as a dependency and configure new microservices to register with it.
